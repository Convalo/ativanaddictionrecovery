              <h2><strong>ATIVAN ADDICTION RECOVERY: A LONG ROAD AHEAD</strong></h2>
              <p>It isn&rsquo;t a far reach to identify <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/the-anxiety-of-ativan">Ativan</a> as the Panzer tank of <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/benzodiazepines-anti-anxiety-addiction-rolled-one">benzodiazepines</a>. In short, it&rsquo;s a powerful and tough drug that&rsquo;s even more tough to get out from under.</p>
              <p>Your best bet if you or a loved one suffers from Ativan addiction is to get professional help. It is not recommended that a person try to recover on their own from Ativan, as <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/faq/when-is-detoxification-necessary">the detox portion</a> of a recovery can be very dangerous, even life threatening.</p>
              <p>Getting into the nitty-gritty of this drug, symptoms that suggest you or someone close to you might have issues with Ativan include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Loss of appetite</li>
                <li>Headaches</li>
                <li>Tremors</li>
                <li>Excess perspiration</li>
                <li>Confusion</li>
                <li>Hallucinations</li>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                <li>Dizziness              </li>
              </ul>
              <h2><strong>BUT WAIT, THERE&rsquo;S MORE</strong></h2>
              <p>Above are listed the symptoms of Ativan abuse, but not what can lead up to the downward stumble into addiction.</p>
              <p>As is the case with many prescription pills, continual use can lead to addiction. Even if a patient follows their doctor&rsquo;s directions when taking Ativan, there still remains the possibility for you as the patient to become addicted to the medicine.</p>
              <p>And therein lies the issue with Ativan recovery. Yes, it can be done, but extra effort might be needed to recover from the drug whose purpose, in this case, is to be an anti-anxiety medication.</p>
              <p>So, in short, your detox and recovery might involve adjusting yourself to be without <em>two </em>drugs: one that has harmed you through its addictive properties, which is a common occurrence with Ativan, while the second drug still remains Ativan, but for the purpose of curbing your anxiousness while in public settings.</p>
              <h2><strong>WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT…</strong></h2>
              <p>… many of the high-powered and eventually overwhelming prescription pills doctors and pharmaceutical companies push on us addict us in two ways, not one.</p>
              <p>First is the physical addiction, which is part and parcel to any prescription opioid or narcotic. But the second is that whatever ailment, be it nervousness, lack of attention, or chronic pain for which the prescription was initially written, now has to be faced with no medication at all; a potential hell in and of itself.</p>
              <p>Consider all this as your doctor prescribes prescription painkillers, anti-anxiety pills or any other type of addictive medication to you. </p>
              <p>When it comes to your ailment vs. the potential for addiction and the pain that <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/why-are-drugs-and-alcohol-so-damned-addictive">addiction</a> in itself can cause, maybe your best bet is to look for an alternative medicine, or at least reconsider taking any medicine at all.</p>
